The XML files contained inside this folder are edited versions
of ePub files downloaded from Wikisource,
the master file being located at URL "https://ta.wikisource.org/wiki/புறப்பொருள்_வெண்பாமாலை"
for which a short form is "https://ta.wikisource.org/s/9b49"

The individual files have been downloaded in ePub format as
புறப்பொருள்_வெண்பாமாலை_வெட்சிப்_படலம்.epub
புறப்பொருள்_வெண்பாமாலை_கரந்தைப்_படலம்.epub
....................

Each .epub file has been opened in oXygen using the Archive Browser
(available under Window | Show View | Archive Browser)

Inside the .epub file, the
OPS/c0_____________________________________.xhtml
file is opened, and saved as a new file, with .xhtml inside another location

After that,
the file is saved as .xml file,
the "<!DOCTYPE html>" is removed
and the top opening tag is changed from
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="ta" dir="ltr">
to <pseudo-html>oXygen)
(the closing tag is automatically changed by oXygen)
An "offset" element, containing an appropriate numerical value, is introduced before the "head" element
(the appropriate value of the offset sometimes takes several attempts to be discovered)

After that, a second .xml file is obtained by running an .xslt script (namely "process_wikimUlam_expanded.xslt")
on the first .xml file and by making additional manual adjustments
(such as:
 -- suppressing extraneous "rank" elements;
 -- replacing some "title" elements by "p" elements;
 -- introducing "cUttiram" elements]
